# Meteor + Solr Search Application Demo

This project demonstrates one approach for using [Solr]() with [Meteor](). It provides the following functionality:

- Meteor based single page search application
- Searches automatically as you type
- Provides Solr facet handling capabilities through custom facet UI widgets
- Demonstrates single level facet refinements through sample Document Type, Date and Author facet widgets
- Demonstrates multi level facet refinements through a sample Categories facet widget
- Tracks general user search actions (search keywords used, number of results found, results selected, page of result selected, facet refinement selected, etc.) via Mongo
